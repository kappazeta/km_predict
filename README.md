# KappaMask (km_predict) :cloud:
KappaMask, or km-predict, is a cloud detector developed by [KappaZeta LTD](https://kappazeta.ee/) for Sentinel-2 Level-1C and Level-2A input products. 
The project was funded by European Space Agency, Contract No. 4000132124/20/I-DT.

Currently, KappaMask outputs results in TIFF and PNG formats. Each pixel is classified as one of the following classes:
Class | TIFF | PNG | Description |
--- | --- | --- | --- | 
Clear | 1 | 66 | Pixels without clouds or cloud shadows. |
Cloud shadow | 2 | 129 | Pixels with cloud shadows. |
Semi-transparent | 3 | 192 | Pixels with thin clouds through which the land is visible; include cirrus clouds that are on the high cloud level (5-15km). |
Cloud | 4 | 255 | Pixels with cloud; include stratus and cumulus clouds that are on the low cloud level (from 0-0.2km to 2km). |
Missing | 5 | 20 |  Missing or invalid pixels. | 

KappaMask has been trained and validated with the following dataset:

## Dependencies
The following system dependencies are needed:
* micromamba 0.18 or later (https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba)
* python 3.6 or later
* cm_vsm dependencies

Due to the long environment solve times with Miniconda, we have switched to Micromamba. If you're still using Conda, Miniconda or similar, simply substitute `micromamba` with `conda` in the relevant commands below.

## Setup
1. Create a micromamba environment.

        micromamba create -f environment.yml

2. Copy `config/config_example.json` and adapt it to your needs.
3. In order to run sub-tiling procedure cm_vsm should be installed (https://github.com/kappazeta/cm-vsm).
4. Make sure that your `GDAL_DATA` environment variable has been set, according to your GDAL version instead of the placeholder `YOUR_GDAL_VERSION` below:

        GDAL_DATA=/usr/share/gdal/YOUR_GDAL_VERSION


## Input data
In the root of repository create a ```/data``` folder and copy or symlink the .SAFE product into it.

## Usage
### Running locally
Cloudmask inference can be run as follows:

    micromamba activate km_predict
    python km_predict.py -c config/your_config.json

It is possible to overwrite product_name in config file with command line argument -product

    python km_predict.py -c config/your_config.json -product S2B_MSIL2A_20200401T093029_N0214_R136_T34UFA_20200401T122148

If the prediction for the same product is running multiple times and .CVAT folder is created under ```/data``` folder, it might be convenient to disable sub_tiling procedure for the next run by -t

    python km_predict.py -c config/your_config.json -product S2B_MSIL2A_20200401T093029_N0214_R136_T34UFA_20200401T122148 -t

### Running in Docker
By default, the KappaMask Docker image runs the `km_s3` entrypoint, which expects a Sentinel-2 product title and output path in an S3 bucket.
The entrypoint performs the following operations:
1. Download the Sentinel-2 product in SAFE format from a Sentinel-Hub requester-pays dataset on AWS.
2. Split the product into sub-tiles with overlap and without compression.
3. Calculate the cloud mask for the product and mosaic the sub-tiles.
4. Tile and compress the resulting mosaic and generate overviews.
5. Upload the mask and sub-tiles to and S3 bucket.

KappaMask can be run as a Docker container as follows:
1. Pull the image

        docker pull kappazeta/kappamask:v2.0

2. Run KappaMask for a specific Sentinel-2 product on AWS (please make sure to replace `YOUR-AWS-REGION`, `YOUR-AWS-ACCESS-KEY`, `YOUR-AWS-SECRET-KEY`, `YOUR-S3-BUCKET` with your AWS configuration, and `YOUR-S2-PRODUCT-NAME` with the name of the product to process)

        docker run -e AWS_REGION=YOUR-AWS-REGION -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR-AWS-ACCESS-KEY -e AWS_SECRET_KEY=YOUR-AWS-SECRET-KEY kappazeta/kappamask:v2.0 YOUR-S2-PRODUCT-NAME s3://YOUR-S3-BUCKET/

For example:

    docker pull kappazeta/kappamask:v2.0
    docker run -e AWS_REGION=eu-central-1 -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY=A******************F -e AWS_SECRET_KEY=3**************************************I kappazeta/kappamask:v2.0 S2A_MSIL2A_20200509T094041_N0214_R036_T35VME_20200509T111504 s3://my-kappamask-experiments/output/

## Output
The predictor will generate sub-tiles masks under ```/prediction``` folder and full S2 mask under ```/big_image``` folder

## Troubleshooting
Potential solutions for typical issues encountered during setup or usage.

### Unable to open EPSG support file
Sentinel-2 product splitting fails with the following messages:

    INFO: KMP.P: Extracting geo-coordinates.
    ERROR 4: Unable to open EPSG support file gcs.csv.  Try setting the GDAL_DATA environment variable to point to the directory containing EPSG csv files.
    ERROR 4: Unable to open EPSG support file gcs.csv.  Try setting the GDAL_DATA environment variable to point to the directory containing EPSG csv files.
    INFO: KMP.P: Projection:
    terminate called after throwing an instance of 'INFO: KMP.P: Projecting AOI polygon into pixel coordinates.
    GDALOGRException'
      what():  GDAL OGR error : Failed to import spatial reference from EPSG, Generic failure
    Magick: abort due to signal 6 (SIGABRT) "Abort"...

This indicates that the environment variable `GDAL_DATA` has not been configured correctly. This could be done in a variety of ways and the preferred method depends on your linux distribution. An export call for the variable (for example, `GDAL_DATA=/usr/share/gdal/2.2`) could be added to your `.bashrc`, `.profile`, etc. Alternatively, the variable could be set together with the python call, for example:

    GDAL_DATA=/usr/share/gdal/2.2 python km_predict.py -c config/your_config.json

### Filesystem error
Sentinel-2 product splitting fails with the following messages:

    terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::filesystem::__cxx11::filesystem_error'
      what():  filesystem error: directory iterator cannot open directory: No such file or directory [YOUR_DIRECTORY/km_predict/data/S2B_MSIL1C_20200401T093029_N0209_R136_T34UFA_20200401T113334.SAFE.SAFE/GRANULE/]
    Magick: abort due to signal 6 (SIGABRT) "Abort"...

This means that km_predict cannot find the directory with the `product_name` specified in the configuration file. The product name in the configuration file should be provided without the `.SAFE` suffix.
